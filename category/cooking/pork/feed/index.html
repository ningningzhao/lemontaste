										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In China, one of the key new year celebration is the family feast at New Year&#8217;s eve. In fact, those new year feast could go all the way from day 1 to the next full moon, which is 15th day after the new year&#8217;s day. Been a child, one of the reason we are looking forward to the new year is you can eat all these yummy food that mum normally wouldn&#8217;t cook. Those dishes usually have special meanings, good wishes for the upcoming year, and of course they all taste really good!</p>
<p>I have been away from China for many years. New year celebration seems become a bit like going through the motions because you are thousand miles away from home. Therefore, I always try to cook some special new year dishes that can bring back some of the memory from the good old days.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve decided to make a Chinese New year series to introduce some special dishes. Let&#8217;s start with an easy one &#8211; Pearl meatball. They’re basically steamed pork meatballs, covered in sticky rice. The hot steam cooks the glutinous rice with moist while helping the rice to absolve all the rich flavoured meat juice. You can smell the beautiful rice and spiced meat flavour coming out of the steamer while being cooked. it&#8217;s just mouthwatering. Once completed, the glutinous rice is soaked with full of meat juice and translucent&#8230;rich and gooey. Those cooked meatballs looks like big shinning pearls on the new year&#8217;s dinner table, it means all family members will stick together with a healthy and happy new year ahead.</p>
<p>Other than a bit of chopping, the rest of the cooking process for this dish is pretty simple. You can also use a food processor to simplify it. The key for this dish is mixing the pork mince. This is where all the flavour comes from. I&#8217;ve inherited my mum&#8217;s version which contains lots of my childhood memory about mummy&#8217;s cooking. There is a secret ingredient my mum loves to use to make any meat dishes. It gives the meat a very special spice flavour which you wouldn&#8217;t have it in any other versions. It also helps to remove any smells from the meat so it works well with beef, lamb or fish dishes as well.</p>
<p><span id="more-273"></span>Here is the secret ingredient, it&#8217;s called Sichuan pepper(花椒). This tiny little pepper has incredible power to influence the flavour in cooking. It&#8217;s a very common and popular spice used in Sichuan style dish, if you love hot spicy food, you probably already know this pepper well. it has nothing to do with black pepper so don&#8217;t try to substitute it with black pepper, they don&#8217;t taste similar at all. Sichuan Pepper can be found in every Asian grocery store, you only need a little bit every time. Here is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sichuan_pepper">wiki page </a>if anyone interested to learn more.</p>

<h5>Instructions</h5>
<h6>Step 1</h6>
<p>Prepare the glutinous rice (Part A) ahead of time, it needs to be soaked in cold water for minimum 8 hours or up to 1 day. This is to make sure the rice can be easily cooked at the same time as the meatball.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170128_085738-1.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20170128_085738" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170128_085738_thumb-1.jpg" alt="20170128_085738" width="331" height="188" border="0" /></a></p>
<h6>Step 2</h6>
<p>Drain the soaked rice and set aside.</p>
<p>Pour all ingredients from part C into the pork mince (Part B) in a large bowl. Then start mix it, make sure you keep stirring in one direction until all well combined.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170129_140127.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20170129_140127" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170129_140127_thumb.jpg" alt="20170129_140127" width="331" height="188" border="0" /></a><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170129_140342.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20170129_140342" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170129_140342_thumb.jpg" alt="20170129_140342" width="331" height="188" border="0" /></a></p>
<h6>Step 3</h6>
<p>Add 2 tablespoons of Sichuan pepper flavoured water at a time into the mixture and continue to stir in the same direction until all water absolved. Then add another 2 tablespoons, lotus root and corn flour continue to stir for at least another 2 minutes. The longer you mix it the more tender the meat ball will be.</p>

<h6>Step 4</h6>
<p>Pour a layer of well drained glutinous rice in a flat plate. Use a spoon to make a meat ball in your hand then roll it in the glutinous rice in circle to make sure it is nicely coated. Repeat the process for the remaining mixture until finish.</p>

<h6>Step 5</h6>
<p>Lay the meatballs carefully into the steamer 2cms apart. You can use any kind of steamers, bamboo steamer or electronic steam. Steam for 12-15mins until the rice cooked and looks clear and shinning.</p>
<h6>Step 6</h6>
<p>Put a soaked goji fruit on top of each meatball and covered the steamer to rest for another 5 minutes. Then it&#8217;s ready to serve.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_1896.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="DSC_1896" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/DSC_1896_thumb.jpg" alt="DSC_1896" width="331" height="222" border="0" /></a></p>
<h5><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Tips:</em></span></h5>
<ul>
<li>These meatballs already have very rich flavour so you don&#8217;t need any dipping sauce.</li>
<li>You can use food processor to cut spring onions and ginger, but I do not recommend using food processors to mix the pork mince.</li>
<li>Lotus root helps to add a bit crunchiness texture into the meatball, if you can&#8217;t find it in Asian grocery shops, it can be substituted with the canned water chestnut. However, please make sure you wash and drain it well to remove any excessive water.</li>
<li>You could use chopped spring onion or coriander instead of goji fruit for decoration as well.</li>
<li>You can store the leftover cooked meatball in airtight container in fridge for up to 3 days. Reheat in steamer for 10 mins to serve.</li>
</ul>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Red Braised Pork Bell (HongShaoRou) &#8211; one of the most popular pork dish in almost every Chinese family. Depends on the city you live in, there are variety of version based on the local eating habit, hot spicy version, rich sweet version or heavy soy taste version… Every family would have their very own recipe which always be related to one of the favorite mummy&#8217;s cooking. However the common technic in this dish for all different versions is called &#8220;HongShao&#8221; (or Red braised) which obviously where the name comes from. It is a technic commonly used in lots of Chinese cooking for both meat and vegetables . It gives meat very shinny caramelised red colour and rich soy flavour. “Stir fry sugar” is the key for this cooking technic. Even though nowadays, there are more and more different seasoning sauce in the market, dark soy sauce, flavoured soy sauce, soy sauce paste which people tend to use more to substitute the stir fry sugar step to simplify the cooking process. However the best part of HongShao flavour would be lost in those simplified version and the colour won&#8217;t look as shinning as the traditional version. Sometime we always wondering why grandma&#8217;s cooking just taste better than anyone else? Because they always use the real food and follow exactly same process in the past 30 years. Time is the magical key, never rush when you are trying to cook a good dish, try to enjoy the process. You will soon realise when you have the first bite that every minute you spent is definitely worthwhile.</p>
<p>Okay enough talking, here is my very own version…not spicy or greasy, more rich soy flavour with a bit sweatiness. Suits everyone in the family especially those little tummies. Let&#8217;s start with ingredients, you will need some basic Chinese spices and seasoning, but should be easy enough to get from any Asian grocery store, will show photos below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prep: 10mins</p>
<p>Cooking: 60mins (clay pot option)/ 35mins (presssure cooker option)</p>
<p>Serve: 3-4</p>
<h5>INGREDIENTS</h5>

<p>1 tablespoon rice cooking wine</p>
<p>4-5 slices of Ginger</p>
<p>2 tablespoons Oil (Any type of oil suitable for high temperature stir fry, I normally use sunflower seed oil or rice brain oil)</p>

<p>30g crushed crystal sugar</p>
<p>2 Spring onions separate the white and green parts</p>
<p>1 star anise</p>

<h6>Part B &#8211; Sauce</h6>
<p>3 tablespoons light soy sauce</p>
<p>1 teaspoon Paprika</p>
<p>1 tablespoon Sweet soybean paste (see photo below)</p>
<p>1 cup hot water &#8211; For pressure cooker option</p>
<p>2 cups hot water &#8211; For clay pot option</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_152115.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20170115_152115" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_152115_thumb.jpg" alt="20170115_152115" width="331" height="188" border="0" /></a></p>
<h6>Part C &#8211; Veggies</h6>
<p>1 bunch baby Bok Choy (A dish can&#8217;t be healthy enough without some greens <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.0.1/72x72/1f609.png" alt="😉" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_160313.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20170115_160313" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_160313_thumb.jpg" alt="20170115_160313" width="331" height="188" border="0" /></a></p>
<h5>INSTRUCTION</h5>
<p>The traditional method is to use clay pot to slow cook the pork belly, however if you have pressure cooker these day, it&#8217;s definitely easier with the same taste outcome. As clay pot is hard to maintain and you have to be around all time during cooking otherwise it is very easy to burn and crack the pot. I&#8217;ll show the instruction for both methods, you can choose whichever way suit you better at home.</p>
<ol>
<li>Prepare a wok or large sauce pan with cold water, add into pork belly cubes, cooking wine, ginger and make sure water covers all meat. Bring to boil for 2 minutes on high heat. Then drain the pork cubes into a bowl set aside. This step is to remove blood and smell from the pork.</li>

<p>2. Prepare a wok on medium heat add in oil and garlic. Fry garlic in the oil until it shows brown bubbles on both sides and you can smell nice garlic flavour from the oil. Turn off the heat and take out all the garlics. Now the oil becomes nice garlic flavoured.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_153913.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20170115_153913" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_153913_thumb.jpg" alt="20170115_153913" width="331" height="188" border="0" /></a><a href="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_154016.jpg"><img loading="lazy" style="background-image: none; padding-top: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin: 0px; display: inline; padding-right: 0px; border: 0px;" title="20170115_154016" src="https://www.lemontaste.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/20170115_154016_thumb.jpg" alt="20170115_154016" width="331" height="188" border="0" /></a></p>
<p>3. Turn on the heat again on medium and add in the pork belly. Sautee the pork belly until outside is all crispy brown. Be careful with this step, drain the pork well before hand and stir frequently to avoid big splashing hot oil. Turn off the heat and take out the pork belly set aside and keep the oil in the wok.</p>

<p>4. While the oil still hot add in crushed sugar then turn back on the heat as medium and stir frequently. To switch off the heat while taking out the pork is to avoid the oil getting too hot before you add in sugar, as it can get burned easily if the oil is too hot. Stir fry the sugar until all melted and start showing bubbles and became nice caramel colour liquored.</p>

<p>5. Add back in the pork belly stir and let the caramel colour coated nicely on the pork. Add in all ingredient from part B (you can pre-mix all the ingredient in part B and add it in all at once).</p>

<p>6. Add star anise, bay leave, ginger and spring onion (white part) mix well and bring to boil.</p>

<h6>Clay Pot Option:</h6>
<p>7.1a. Transfer everything into a pre-heated clay pot, cover the lid and cook on lowest heat for 45 minutes. Check and stir every 15mins to make sure the meat is not stick at the bottom of the pot and you have enough sauce in the pot. Especially in the last 20 minutes, as the sauce gets thicker and the sugar in the sauce can get easily burned if you leave it cook for too long.</p>
<p>7.1b. Once the sauce becomes very sticky and pork belly is soft and shows shinny caramel colour. Remove it from the heat, sprinkle the finely chopped spring onions on top and cover the lid, let it rest for 5-10mins, the sauce will become thicker and absolve the spring onion flavour.</p>

<p><em>(Photos above shows the pork cooked in clay pot for 15 minutes, 30 minutes and 45 minutes from left to right.)</em></p>
<h6>Pressure Cooker Option:</h6>
<p>7.2. Transfer everything into pressure cooker, cook for 20mins on medium pressure. Wait for pressure to release, switch to sauté for 5mins. Once you are happy with the thickness of the sauce, pour into the serving plate/bowl and sprinkle finely chopped spring onions on top and decorate with the prepared Bok choy from the steps below.</p>
<h6>Prepare the vegetable:</h6>
<p>8. While the pork is simmering in the clay pot/pressure cooker, prepare the Bok choy. Wash the Bok choy and drain set aside.</p>
<p>9. Prepare a pot of water add in a pinch of salt and bring to boil. Then add in the Bok choy and cook for half minute.</p>
<p>10. Take the Bok choy out and raise with cold water, then lay the Bok choy nicely in a circle in your prepared serving plate/bowl.</p>

<p>11. When the pork belly is ready, pour the pork carefully into the central of your serving dish. With clay pot, you can serve directly with the pot, just add the Bok choy in before you rest the pork at the end in Step 7.1b. Serve hot with a bowl of steam rice.</p>

<h6><em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tips:</span></em></h6>
<ul>
<li>For 500g pork belly you will need a medium size clay pot (minimum of 2L capacity ) to allow enough water for cooking. The one I used in the photo is about 2.2L.</li>
<li>Sweet soybean paste is to increase the rich soy flavour, but it’s not mandatory if you can’t find it. The brand I used in the photo has very good sweet taste, some of the brand can be really salty even it called ‘Sweet soybean paste’. If you are not sure, taste it before you add into your sauce. If it&#8217;s very salty, don&#8217;t use it.</li>
<li>For clay pot, the cooking time is much longer and you have to make sure there are enough water added after you transfer everything into the clay pot. Add water in the middle is not recommended, it will impact the flavour of the final dish.</li>
<li>When stir fry sugar, avoid to over fry and burn. Get everything ready close by before you start this step. Mix the sauce upfront if you are first time making it. As the sugar can get burn in seconds after reach certain temperature, then you will have bitter taste in your dish.</li>
</ul>
