###### Step 4

Dissolve gelatine powder in warm water then pour into the 300g mango purée mix well.

Use an electric mixer to beat the cream and cheese until smooth and just start getting fluffy, showing ripples but disappear immediately. Then fold 1/3 cream mix into mango purée, mix well. Then fold it back into the remaining cream mix.

###### Step 5

Pour 1/3 the mousse mixture over the biscuit base. Top with half the mango cubes, then cover with another 1/3 mousse mixture. Top with the remaining mango cubes but not in the central , pour the 50g Mango purée carefully in the centre of the cake, then cover with the remaining mousse mixture. Make sure to start pouring the mixture from the outside first and slowly circle into the centre to cover the soft heart of the mousse cake. Shake the pan slightly to make the even surface.

###### _Tips:_

  * In total you will need about 2 large mangos to make this 6 inches cake, another half mango for decoration.
  * If you use Gelatine pieces instead of powder, you need about 2.5 pieces to set 6 inches cake.
