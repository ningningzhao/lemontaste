## Instructions

###### **Step 1**

Prepare the stock, it is important to have rich stock that's where the most of the flavour comes from in the paella. I like to use mixture of seafood and chicken stock. you can use any stock you like, even canned chicken stock from supermarket will do if you are in the rush. The stock can be prepared a day ahead to shorten the cooking time in one day.

Heat up 1 tablespoon olive oil in a pot, add in prawn shell tossed it often until the oil turns into yellow/orange colour with nice seafood smell. Add into chicken bones and pour into boiled water, make sure water covers all ingredients. Bring to boil for 10 mins, then turn into medium heat continue to simmer for another 30 mins or until the soup reduced to the half of the volume. Drain the stock into a bowel set aside.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em><strong>Tips:</strong></em></span>

  * Don't stir the rice after stock added in. This is to avoid too much starch comes out of the rice which could cause the paella turn out too sticky. Good paella should maintain the tender taste of rice when it's done.
  * Add salt and pepper in the stock before add into the pan to avoid stir the rice.
  * Choose similar size seafood to ensure all seafood cooked evenly.
  * How to peel fresh tomato: slightly crossed the skin at the bottom of the tomato then soak in hot water for 5 minutes. The skin will easily peeled off itself.
